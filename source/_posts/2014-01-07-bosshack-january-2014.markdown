So on Saturday, January 25th, starting at 9AM CST, we're going to be meeting up
at the [Isotope11](http://www.isotope11.com) offices at 529 Beacon Parkway,
Suite 105, Birmingham, AL 35209 for another hackathon.

The idea is that a few people will come with projects of their own to work on,
and some people might meet up and decide to hack on something together.  So far,
here's what we've got planned:

- Josh Adams will be working on building a [KeyGlove](http://keyglove.net).
  He's already ordered all of the parts, but if you wanted to build one too
  there's sufficient time for you to order the parts ahead of time so we can all
  do it together.

If you know what you want to work on, comment and I'll add it to the post so we
can keep track of it up top.  Looking forward to it!
