  I decided to use
  %a{:href => "http://octopress.org/"} Octopress
  for this blog since it works with
  %a{:href => "http://pages.github.com/"} Github Pages
  , it's got
  %a{:href => "http://haml.info/"} HAML
  support and it's a self-described
  %em blogging framework for hackers.
  As it turns out, the procedure for actually making a post is pretty
  technical.   I don't want to the be the only one making posts about our
  Hack-A-Thon(s), so here is the procedure for making posts.</p>

<p>%p
  %a{:href => "http://octopress.org/"} Octopress
  is a self-described
  %strong blogging framework for hackers.  Most of the folks in the BOSS meetup
  fit that description, so it shouldn't be too tough.   You'll need a
  %a{:href => "http://github.com"} Github
  account, some rudimentary
  %a{:href => "http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/"}ruby
  skillz, and a burning desire to put something on the Interwebs.  I'll use
  %a{:href => "http://haml.info"} HAML
  for all of the examples, but you can use Jekyll if you want.</p>

<p>%p
  %strong Let's get started!
  %ul</p>

<pre><code>%li
  Fork it!
  %p
    Make a fork of
    %code git@github.com:bosshack/bosshack.github.com.git
%li
  Clone
  %strong your
  repo and go to that directory (probably
  %strong bosshack.github.com
  )
  %p
    %code
      git clone git@github.com:
      %strong&gt; YOURGITHUBIDHERE/
      bosshack.github.com.git
    %br/
    Most people will need to make changes to their own fork instead of the master
%li
  Add a remote named upstream that points to the master repo
  %p
    %code
      git remote add upstream git@github.com:bosshack/bosshack.github.com.git
    %br/
    You may want to send a pull request if you have a post or changes to a post
%li
  Delete the contents of the
  %strong _deploy
  directory if it exists.  It shouldn't
  %p
    %code rm -rf _deploy
    %br/
    We're gonna clone
    %strong your
    fork
    %strong again
    into the
    %strong _deploy
    directory
%li
  Checkout the
  %strong source
  branch
  %p
    %code
      git checkout source
    %br/
    The source branch is where the posts and pages are written in your markup style of choice.
%li
  Clone your fork to the _deploy directory (seems redundant, right? - it's kind of cool actually)
  %p
    %code
      git clone git@github.com:
      %strong&gt; YOURGITHUBIDHERE/
      bosshack.github.com.git
      %strong _deploy
%li
  Bundle that Sh*t
  %p
    %code bundle
%li
  Preview the site on port
  %a{:href =&gt; "http://localhost:4000"}localhost:4000
  %p
    %code
      rake preview
    %br/
    This command will watch the source directory for changes and
    regenerate the site when something changes
%li
  Make a post
  %p
    %code rake new_post["My Awesome Post Title"]
    %br/
    This creates a new file in the
    %strong source/_posts
    directory with a filename like YYYY-MM-DD-my-awesome-post-title.haml with
    %a{:href =&gt; "https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/YAML-Front-Matter"}YAML Front Matter.
    Feel free to change the extension to .markdown if you would rather edit in
    %a{:href =&gt; "http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/"}Markdown.
%li
  Edit the file above as appropriate.   Continually check your work in the browser and
  in the session where you ran
  %br/
  %code rake preview
  %br/
  Any HAML/Markdown/etc errors will show up in the STDOUT of that command.
%li
  Add your post to the git
  %strong source
  branch and commit
  %p
    %code git add source/_posts/*
    %br/
    %code git commit -m "Created an awesome blog post for bosshack.org"
%li
  Push the changes to your fork and send a pull request to
  %a{:href =&gt; "https://github.com/bosshack"}bosshack
  if you want it included on the site.
%li
  If you run into any problems with these instructions, leave a comment below and I'll update
  them accordingly
