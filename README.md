Bosshack Generated Blog
=======================

You are currently looking at the master branch of the [Bosshack](http://bosshack.org "Hacking with the Birmingham Open Source Software Group") Github Pages blog.

We're using [Octopress](http://octopress.org/ "Octopress: A blogging framework for hackers") 
and this is the resultant site.  [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/ "The easiest way to quickly publish beautiful pages for you and your projects")
kind of requires that the site be on the master branch.  If you're interested in the source, then you'll find 
that on the source branch.
