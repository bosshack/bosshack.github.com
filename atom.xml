    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So the Google Hangout formula seemed to work out for this planning meetup.  I&#8217;ve embedded it at the bottom of this post.</p>
<p>
  We talked about quite a few things.  It was agreed upon that we&#8217;d expect to see
  a list of projects with sponsors, and that in general there&#8217;d only be one project
  per sponsor.  Then anyone who was interested in that project could sign on and say
  &#8220;yeah, I&#8217;d like to help with that.&#8221;  That&#8217;s pretty much all of the rigor that will
  go into figuring out the projects ahead of time - we&#8217;ll organize online and hopefully
  have a good feel for what we&#8217;re doing by the time that we arrive.
</p>
<p>
  I&#8217;ve updated the
  <a href='http://bosshack.org/first-hackathon-nominations/index.html'>potential projects</a>
  list to reflect newly suggested projects.  If someone feels that a project is dead,
  feel free to submit a PR with it removed.  If you want a project added, send a PR
  with the new project (or mention it in a comment and we can help out).
</p>
<p>Within a week or so, we should remove projects that haven&#8217;t had a champion yet.  If you&#8217;d like to nominate yourself as a champion for a given project, either send a PR with yourself listed on the project on this page, or mention it in comments (lazy) and we&#8217;ll put it up there for you.</p>

  BOSS will hold it&#8217;s December meetup at 6pm CST on 17-Dec, 2012.  Since the holidays are so near and many of our regular attendees
  have a busy social calendar this meeting will be via Google Hangout.
  <a href='https://github.com/knewter'>Josh</a>
  has scheduled the
  <a href='https://plus.google.com/u/0/events/clkj95bn5ft5nge19ggfonpgodc'>hangout</a>
  so click the link to get a reminder.
</p>
<p>
  Participation in the hangout is optional.  Members that prefer to attend the meeting at the
  <a href='http://isotope11.com/contact'>isotope | eleven Offices</a>
  are encoraged to do so.
</p>
<p>
  Our adgenda for this meeting will be:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Planning the logistics for the
      <a href='http://bosshack.org/blog/2012/11/27/first-boss-hack-a-thon-scheduled/'>Hack-A-Thon</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      Reviewing the current list of project
      <a href='http://bosshack.org/first-hackathon-nominations/index.html'>nominations</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      Whatever else comes up&#8230;
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  As is the case with any hacker meeting, familiarity with the technology involved (Google Hangout)
  is encouraged.  You may desire to share your screen, mute your audio, or put a mustache on your image.
  Be Prepared&#8230;.
</p>
<h1>Hope to see you on Monday!</h1>

    <updated>2012-12-04T19:50:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://bosshack.org/blog/2012/12/04/so-you-want-to-make-posts-to-this-blog</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>
  I decided to use
  <a href='http://octopress.org/'>Octopress</a>
  for this blog since it works with
  <a href='http://pages.github.com/'>Github Pages</a>
  , it&#8217;s got
  <a href='http://haml.info/'>HAML</a>
  support and it&#8217;s a self-described
  <em>blogging framework for hackers.</em>
  As it turns out, the procedure for actually making a post is pretty
  technical.   I don&#8217;t want to the be the only one making posts about our
  Hack-A-Thon(s), so here is the procedure for making posts.
</p>
<p>
  <a href='http://octopress.org/'>Octopress</a>
  is a self-described
  <strong>blogging framework for hackers.</strong>
  Most of the folks in the BOSS meetup
  fit that description, so it shouldn&#8217;t be too tough for anyone.   You&#8217;ll need a
  <a href='http://github.com'>Github</a>
  account, some rudimentary
  <a href='http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/'>ruby</a>
  and git skillz, and a burning desire to put something on the Interwebs.  I&#8217;ll use
  <a href='http://haml.info'>HAML</a>
  for most of my posts, but you can use
  <a href='https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll'>Jekyll</a>
  or
  <a href='http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/'>Markdown</a>
  if you want.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Let&#8217;s get started!</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Fork it!
      <p>
        Make a fork of
        <code>git@github.com:bosshack/bosshack.github.com.git</code>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      Clone
      <strong>your</strong>
      repo and go to that directory (probably
      <strong>bosshack.github.com</strong>
      )
      <p>
        <code>git clone git@github.com:<strong>YOURGITHUBIDHERE/</strong>bosshack.github.com.git</code>
        <br />
        Most people will need to make changes to their own fork instead of the master
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      Add a remote named upstream that points to the master repo
      <p>
        <code>git remote add upstream git@github.com:bosshack/bosshack.github.com.git</code>
        <br />
        You may want to send a pull request if you have a post or changes to a post
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      Delete the contents of the
      <strong>_deploy</strong>
      directory if it exists.  It shouldn&#8217;t
      <p>
        <code>rm -rf _deploy</code>
        <br />
        We&#8217;re gonna clone
        <strong>your</strong>
        fork
        <strong>again</strong>
        into the
        <strong>_deploy</strong>
        directory
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      Checkout the
      <strong>source</strong>
      branch
      <p>
        <code>git checkout source</code>
        <br />
        The source branch is where the posts and pages are written in your markup style of choice.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      Clone your fork to the _deploy directory (seems redundant, right? - it&#8217;s kind of cool actually)
      <p>
        <code>git clone git@github.com:<strong>YOURGITHUBIDHERE/</strong>bosshack.github.com.git
        <strong>_deploy</strong></code>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      Bundle that Sh*t
      <p>
        <code>bundle</code>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      Preview the site on port
      <a href='http://localhost:4000'>localhost:4000</a>
      <p>
        <code>rake preview</code>
        <br />
        This command will watch the source directory for changes and
        regenerate the site when something changes
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      Make a post
      <p>
        <code>rake new_post["My Awesome Post Title"]</code>
        <br />
        This creates a new file in the
        <strong>source/_posts</strong>
        directory with a filename like YYYY-MM-DD-my-awesome-post-title.haml with
        <a href='https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/YAML-Front-Matter'>YAML Front Matter.</a>
        Feel free to change the extension to .markdown if you would rather edit in
        <a href='http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/'>Markdown.</a>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      Edit the file above as appropriate.   Continually check your work in the browser and
      in the session where you ran
      <br />
      <code>rake preview</code>
      <br />
      Any HAML/Markdown/etc errors will show up in the STDOUT of that command.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add your post to the git
      <strong>source</strong>
      branch and commit
      <p>
        <code>git add source/_posts/*</code>
        <br />
        <code>git commit -m "Created an awesome blog post for bosshack.org"</code>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      Push the changes to your fork and send a pull request to
      <a href='https://github.com/bosshack'>bosshack</a>
      if you want it included on the site.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you run into any problems with these instructions, leave a comment below and I&#8217;ll update
      them accordingly
    </li>
  </ul>
